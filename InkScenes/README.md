## InkScenes Scripts

In this folder, we provide scripts that were used for generating the InkScenes dataset. For details, please refer to the paper. For questions, please reach out to miatang@stanford dot edu. Thank you so much for your interests.

### Brush augmentation script

We recommend using `vscode+ExtendedScript` for running our script (with access to Illustrator). All necessary instructions are provided within the `brush_augmentation_script.jsx` file. For more instructions please reference [this repository](https://github.com/ivanpuhachov/line-drawing-vectorization-polyvector-flow-dataset). 

### Visualizing Ground Truth .mat Files

We offer a visualization script to help you visualize the ground truth label matrices stored in .mat files. This script can generate colored images from the label matrices, making it easier to inspect the annotations.
