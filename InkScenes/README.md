## InkScenes Scripts

In this folder, we provide scripts that were used for generating the InkScenes dataset. For details, please refer to the paper. For questions, please reach out to miatang@stanford dot edu. Thank you so much for your interests.

### Brush augmentation script

We recommend using `vscode+ExtendedScript` for running our script (with access to Illustrator). All necessary instructions are provided within the `brush_augmentation_script.jsx` file. Our brushes (and some more) are included in this illustrator file shared in this [google drive .ai file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15yIGniZkEIUom8G3H4pGQzeMM9wRB7sh/view?usp=sharing). For more instructions please reference [this repository](https://github.com/ivanpuhachov/line-drawing-vectorization-polyvector-flow-dataset). If you run into problems with 32-bit vs 64-bit with the `.ai` file, consider the solution suggested in this [issue](https://github.com/miatang13/InkLayer/issues/1)'s thread.
