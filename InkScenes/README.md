## InkScenes Scripts

In this folder, we provide scripts that were used for generating the InkScenes dataset. For details, please refer to the paper. For questions, please reach out to miatang@stanford dot edu. Thank you so much for your interests.

### Brush augmentation script

We recommend using `vscode+ExtendedScript` for running our script (with access to Illustrator). All necessary instructions are provided within the `brush_augmentation_script.jsx` file. For more instructions please reference [this repository](https://github.com/ivanpuhachov/line-drawing-vectorization-polyvector-flow-dataset).
